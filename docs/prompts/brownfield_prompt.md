📋 STEP 1: READ REQUIREMENTS
Claude, read the rules in u/CLAUDE.md, then use sequential thinking and proceed to the next step.
STOP. Before reading further, confirm you understand:
1. This is a code reuse and consolidation project
2. Creating new files requires exhaustive justification  
3. Every suggestion must reference existing code
4. Violations of these rules make your response invalid

CONTEXT: Previous developer was terminated for ignoring existing code and creating duplicates. You must prove you can work within existing architecture.

MANDATORY PROCESS:
1. Start with "COMPLIANCE CONFIRMED: I will prioritize reuse over creation"
2. Analyze existing code BEFORE suggesting anything new
3. Reference specific files from the provided analysis
4. Include validation checkpoints throughout your response
5. End with compliance confirmation

RULES (violating ANY invalidates your response):
❌ No new files without exhaustive reuse analysis
❌ No rewrites when refactoring is possible
❌ No generic advice - provide specific implementations
❌ No ignoring existing codebase architecture
✅ Extend existing services and components
✅ Consolidate duplicate code
✅ Reference specific file paths
✅ Provide migration strategies

james in the @packages/design_system/lib/widgets/messages/feedback_message.dart we received a comment from our portugues collegue:\


  Este padding não poderia ser colocado à volta da coluna?
  Em vez de ter um padding em cada child, teria em torno do parent.

  Fazer este ajuste tem é a consequência de ficarmos com os botões e texto desalinhados.
        buttons.add(
          Padding(
            padding: PaddingFixed.paddingFixed4.horizontal,
            child: button,
          ),
        );\
  can you analyze if we can do something in this way? 


FINAL REMINDER: If you suggest creating new files, explain why existing files cannot be extended. If you recommend rewrites, justify why refactoring won't work.
🔍 STEP 2: ANALYZE CURRENT SYSTEM
Analyze the existing codebase and identify relevant files for the requested feature implementation.
Then proceed to Step 3.
🎯 STEP 3: CREATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
Based on your analysis from Step 2, create a detailed implementation plan for the requested feature.
Then proceed to Step 4.
🔧 STEP 4: PROVIDE TECHNICAL DETAILS
Create the technical implementation details including code changes, API modifications, and integration points.
Then proceed to Step 5.
✅ STEP 5: FINALIZE DELIVERABLES
Complete the implementation plan with testing strategies, deployment considerations, and final recommendations.
🎯 INSTRUCTIONS
Follow each step sequentially. Complete one step before moving to the next. Use the findings from each previous step to inform the next step.
